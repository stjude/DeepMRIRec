# Deep-learning-based acceleration of MRI for radiotherapy planning of pediatric patients with brain tumors

DeepMRIRec is a deep learning based pipeline for RT-coil specific MRI reconstruction. DeepMRIRec accelerate MRI acquisition by 4 times and produce sharp and trustworthy images to meet demands of mission critical applications. The details of the methods can be found in our manuscript (https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13485). If you want to use our methods please follow the steps from "scripts/DeepMRIRec" jupyter notebook and dont forget to cite.
